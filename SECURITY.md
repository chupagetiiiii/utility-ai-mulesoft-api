# Security Policy

## üîê Security Standards

This platform implements enterprise-grade security for critical infrastructure protection:

### Compliance
- **NERC CIP**: North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection
- **FERC Standards**: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality

### API Security
- **OAuth 2.0**: Token-based authentication for all APIs
- **mTLS**: Mutual TLS for system-to-system communication
- **API Keys**: Client ID enforcement with rate limiting
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restricted access for critical infrastructure APIs

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Key Management**: HSM-based key storage
- **Data Masking**: PII and sensitive grid data protection

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security@utility-ai-platform.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit credentials or secrets
2. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Implement input validation on all APIs
4. Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines
5. Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### For Operators
1. Enable audit logging on all critical APIs
2. Monitor for anomalous API usage patterns
3. Implement network segmentation
4. Regular security assessments and penetration testing
5. Maintain incident response procedures
