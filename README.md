# ⚡ Utility AI Semantic Layer – MuleSoft API-Led Project

This GitHub-ready project implements a full MuleSoft API-led connectivity architecture designed for utility companies, enabling real-time coordination and emergency grid restoration using AI and critical infrastructure systems.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

- **System APIs**: Access data from SCADA, Salesforce Energy Cloud, weather APIs, and inventory systems.
- **Process APIs**: Orchestrate business logic for grid restoration, agent coordination, and emergency response.
- **Experience APIs**: Provide tailored data to mobile agents, clinics, and control centers.

Follows MuleSoft Best Practices:
- API-first design using OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Layered architecture (System, Process, Experience)
- Reusable DataWeave transformations
- Secure, monitored, and versioned APIs

```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Design APIs

Use the OpenAPI specs under `/api-specs/` in Design Center or VS Code with MuleSoft Anypoint extension.

### 2. Implement APIs

Use MuleSoft Anypoint Studio to import each folder under `/mule-apps/` and build the implementation.

### 3. Secure APIs

Use API Manager to apply:
- OAuth 2.0 / Client ID policies
- Spike control
- IP whitelisting (for grid-critical APIs)

### 4. Monitor and Test

- Use Anypoint Monitoring for real-time observability.
- Use MUnit (under `/tests/`) for unit testing and coverage.

## 📌 Key Features

- 10-minute AI-driven grid recovery scenario
- Integrated with weather, SCADA, inventory, and emergency management
- Modular and scalable for any utility provider
- Aligns with regulatory and safety compliance needs

### 🧠 Key Benefits Illustrated by the Architecture

| Benefit                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| ⚡ **Real-Time Coordination**     | A2A agents coordinate across SCADA, outage maps, and field assets to prioritize power restoration. |
| 🏥 **Life-Critical Infrastructure** | AI detects clinics and hospitals affected by outages and reprioritizes grid segments. |
| 🔄 **Unified Grid Intelligence**  | Combines weather data, asset status, field work orders, and emergency alerts in a semantic layer. |
| 🧩 **Composable APIs**           | Follows MuleSoft’s best practice of reusable, discoverable APIs across grid layers. |
| 🚑 **10-Minute Recovery Path**   | AI + API-led connectivity compress response time from hours to minutes. |
| 🔐 **Safe, Compliant Operations**| Supports regulatory compliance, restoration coordination, and safety-critical thresholds. |

### 💡 How to Use This Architecture

- Use the image as a **reference map** when creating System, Process, and Experience APIs.
- It helps Solution Engineers and Integration Architects identify which **data sources, priorities, and coordination flows** need to be implemented in each layer.
- Drives the **CI/CD automation and alerting logic** for emergency grid restoration workflows.
